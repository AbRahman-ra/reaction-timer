## Project Description

Reaction Timer is a small, easy & funny game, to start: click on the
"Play" button below, then wait for the random timer to finish and the
block appears (Note that the block will show up in a random place on the
screen ðŸ˜ˆ), after the block appears, a new timer will start counting the
time needed to press the appeared block again, based on your reflex speed,
you will be given a rank
